#
#message ORBIT_FROM_HILBERT
You settle into the pilot's couch and grasp the controls. There is a surge of power, and the viewscreen goes haywire. Once again everything goes green and you feel the wrench of traversing Hilbert Space...
The acrid smell of burning tells you something is wrong in the engine room. There's a graunching noise, then in a shower of sparks, the n-space converter blows, severely damaging your engines.

You moisten the soap until it is soft and then use it to lubricate the lever. Even so your puny strength is not enough to shift it...
#
#message MN66
You moisten the soap until it is soft and then use it to lubricate the lever. You give the lever a mighty pull and it swings downward and then bounces back to its old position.
#
#message MN67

A message flashes up onto its screen: "Vandalizing public property is an offense carrying a 6,000,000 IG fine, payable immediately." Sheepishly, you feed the appropriate number of coins into the droid and it releases you and trundles away, carrying your monkey wrench.

#
#message MN103
As you prepare for the hyperspace jump an Imperial Starguard cutter zooms in alongside, and you are boarded by customs officers who find a number of contraband objects, which they confiscate. You are given a stern warning about the consequences of trying it again, and allowed to proceed...

#message MN107

#
#message MN116
One normally puts coins or tokens into slots, m'dear! (That could just possibly be a hint!)
#
#message MN117
You fumble around trying to get it into the slot, but at the end of the day your dexterity just isn't up to it!
#
#message MN118
You simply can't afford to waste groats on a luxury like Shredded Wheat!
#
#message MN119
You put it into the slot and the machine disgorges a Shredded Wheat. You wolf it down and are about to leave when the machine produces another! You grab and eat that too. With a groaning noise the machine offers a THIRD Shredded Wheat. Taking a deep breath you bite into the THIRD Shredded Wheat... Somewhere in space a Black Hole blanches! As you stand stupefied from the effort, a passing patient relieves you of your wallet!
#
#message MN120
You strive to lift the barbells, but for all your huffing and puffing you are unable to budge them. You stagger off totally exhausted to get some refreshment...
#
#message MN122
Ignoring the fact that it is double gravity you strut over to the barbells and prepare to lift them above your head...

With a terrific burst of exertion you manage to get the barbells over your head. Unfortunately, you are unable to sustain the feat and you let the barbells slip, crushing yourself to death beneath them. The spectators in the gallery applaud your demise enthusiastically!
#
#message MN124
Ignoring the fact that it is double gravity you strut over to the barbells and prepare to lift them above your head...

You succeed in lifting the barbells above your head. This so impresses the resident instructor that she offers you a {%'ld} IG body-building course. Sadly, you haven't got that sort of cash, and so you are forced to refuse her offer.
#

#message MN129_548
The shuttle doors close. There is a smooth and rapid acceleration. The rock walls swish hypnotically past until, with a start, you realize that you are pulling into a station. A disembodied voice says "MIND THE GAP!" The doors slide open and you can see the platform of the Cargon City station.

#
#message MN141
You've already got a spaceship! You need to sell it before you can buy another one.
#
#message MN143
An obsequious sales droid wearing an oily smile intercepts you before you can reach the booth and begins to extol the virtues of the yard's ships, especially the starter models which come with a free once-only life insurance policy. Impatiently you wave it aside and order it get on with the sale! The droid punches buttons and feeds in the credit agreement.

The computer points out that you haven't paid the rent this month but eventually the paperwork goes through. 10%% will be deducted from your income until the loan is repaid.

The droid invites you over to a window, and you look down on the main assembly floor as the prefabricated sections are welded together to build your ship. Finally, the completed spaceship is moved out onto the launching pad for you to take delivery...

Congratulations, Commander {%s}. Good Trading!

You are about to ask the messenger for the whereabouts of the Grand Master when you realize that he has already left.

The warehouse workers have gone on strike over the miserable wages you pay them!
#
#message MN157
Don't you think that you would find it easier if you were in an exchange?
#
#message MN158
Since you don't have anywhere in your hold to store the purchase the stevedores leave it stacked next to the ship... from where it is promptly nicked!
#
#message MN160
The goods are stacked outside the exchange awaiting your collection -- from whence they are promptly nicked...

#message MN188
There is a roar of a violent explosion from the direction of the ruins. The ground buckles and you are thrown against the wall by the blast. You get to your feet, bruised and battered.

#
#message MN189
There is a sudden vast surge of power. The walls become transparent and everything is etched in a diamond hard white light. Within microseconds, the entire ruins are vaporized.

#
#message MN190
Around you the walls start to glow with a pearly light, and the blue glow in the reactor pit intensifies. A receptacle in the main control panel opens...

#
#message MN191
You suddenly realize that you don't have the correct item to place in the receptacle...

#
#message MN192
As you move to put the diamond into the receptacle it emits a piercing tone. Clutching your head you drop the diamond, which shatters on the floor.

#
#message MN193
You move to the panel and fit the diamond into the receptacle. The panel slides shut again, and everything returns to normality.

#
#message MN194
Unfortunately, you don't have the appropriate card, and you are escorted off the premises by two very large marines! Before you try again I suggest you obtain the necessary pass...

#
#message MN195
As you start to go through the door way a marine guard suddenly appears and politely but firmly tells you that the base is off-limits to non-authorized personnel.
#
#message MN196
As you reach to take the globe, there is a huge surge of energy from its surface, which knocks you backwards and severely burns you.
#
#message MN197
As you reach out a massive spark jumps from the globe to the opal you are carrying. The opal silently absorbs the energy without showing any ill effects.

#
#message MN198
Grasping the globe with both hands you try to wrestle it off the top of the pillar. Eventually, you realize that you are going to need a tool to get it free, and you desist from your attempts.

#
#message MN199
Using the monkey wrench you are able to unscrew the globe from the top of the pillar. Carefully you place the opal in the receptacle revealed, and replace the globe.
There is a few seconds silence and then the machine starts to hum. The hum races up the scale and the pitch is soon too high to hear.

#
#message MN200
Unfortunately you lack the experience to control the machine and it rapidly runs into overload.
The resulting explosion causes extensive damage to the surroundings, and totally pulverizes your puny body!

#
#message MN201
Controlling the machine strains your mental powers to the utmost, but you channel the power output to the hydrogen fusion plant elsewhere in the ruins. There is a build up of power...

#
#message MN202
Suddenly you realize that the controller is not in place.
Frantically you try to damp down the plant but the energy runs amok, and with a devastating nuclear explosion the ruins, and all within, are turned into a smoking crater.

#
#message MN203
Everything runs smoothly as your colleague installs the plant's controller, and the power builds up to maximum.

#
#message MN204
Suddenly it dawns on you that you failed to set up the distribution net, so there is no where for the power to go...
Too late...
The resulting explosion not only wipes out the ruins, it also does severe damage to Marsport!

#
#message MN205
With a flash, the globe and the monkey wrench you are holding are vaporized, but luckily you escape injury. The network controller is safely installed and power starts to flow again. All over the ruins, long dormant devices come to life...

#
#message Salute
Snapping smartly to attention you salute, though I can't think why...
#
#message SaluteKatov
As you salute, the admiral looks up and smiles. "Congratulations," she tells you. She hands you an ID card stating that you hold a commission in the Naval Intelligence Service, and a message telling you to report to HQ. You ask where the HQ is, but the admiral is already busy with her work again. She waves vaguely in a southeasterly direction. Never mind - a person of your ability should find it easily!
#
#message MN207
Wheeeeee... you have great fun sliding down the banister. When you get to the bottom the butler scowls at you and asks what you think you are playing at! What a party pooper! You break all records for the 100 meter slink to get back up the stairs...
#
#message MN208
You tug at the shelves, twisting and pulling them, but you are unable to move them. I guess you are just not nimble enough to move them in such a confined space - if indeed they do move!
#
#message MN209
As you twist one corner of the shelving there is a quiet click, and a section slides away to reveal a small bare room. As you step into the room, the shelving slides silently closed behind you.
#
#message MN210
Around you the walls start to glow with a pearly light, and the block looks like an inky pool of Stygian darkness. After a while you notice a soft glow from the block outlining a depression into which a vandier can be fitted...
#
#message MN212
As you move to place the vandier into the depression you realize that you have no idea how to activate it! Fumbling nervously you drop it...
#
#message MN213
You move to the block and fit the vandier into the depression. The vandier vanishes abruptly and everything returns to normal. As your eyes adjust you detect a subtle change in the light from the next room.
#
#message MN214
As you move there is another surge of energy. You black out, and when you come to you find that you are elsewhere in the ruins...

#message DrinkWHOOSHNoEffect

You drop the thimble into the boojum. Before it touches the machine a defense mechanism comes into play and the thimble vaporizes in a blinding flash. Alarms blare out and the lasers focus onto you. You don't get a chance to see the blinding flash that marks your demise!!!

#message MN221
The dog takes the cookie and crunches it noisily. It wags its tail and looks at you hopefully - obviously looking for another one! As it moves you see that there is trapdoor in the floor. Reaching down you are able to tug it open, revealing a set of steps leading down to the shimmer of a teleportal...
#
#message MARIO
Mario takes one look at the packet of drugs and gets up from the table. Signing you to follow him, he sets out at a rapid pace. You follow cautiously. Mario takes you to the office of the man known as 'The Godfather' and withdraws, leaving just the two of you...

#
#message GodfatherBelowJP
There is a slight noise behind you and you start to turn, but too late. A noose slips over your head and you are garroted for the drugs that you carry. You were playing way out of your depth and paid the penalty for your temerity!
#
#message GodfatherDoneSnark
The Godfather looks at you. "You really think we would fall for that trick again after the Snark affair? You must think that because we live on the moon we're stupid!" Even as he speaks, hands grab you from behind and you feel a noose slip around your neck...
#
#message GodfatherNoBadge
The Godfather looks at you. "Good work," he grunts. "I may have a task for you in the future."
#
#message GodfatherOK
The Godfather looks at you. "Good work," he grunts. "I have a task for you. I want you to check the security at the pirate base on Snark. You can enter it in the Martian ruins once you have activated the power system." He hands you a bright yellow badge, saying, "Keep this with you, it identifies you as my representative. It should get you into most areas that are not too sensitive."
#
#message MN225
You show the watch to the white rabbit. It looks at the watch and says, "Dear me! Is that the time? I'm going to be late...". With you following closely it hurries off. You follow it down a series of narrow maze-like alleyways, and in and out of ruined buildings until it suddenly vanishes, leaving you looking round in a bemused manner, still clutching the watch!
#
#message DieselNoMoney
Diesel accepts the token of your esteem and tucks it into her ample cleavage, but says "Sorry, darling, you couldn't possibly afford my prices! Why don't you come back when you're richer?" Blushing furiously, you vow to return once you have made your fortune. She gives you a friendly kiss and buys you a drink.

#
#message DieselEvent_F
Diesel accepts your gift and tucks it into her ample cleavage. Taking you by the hand she leads you into a dimly lit chamber where she extracts {%'ld} IG from your bulging wallet, and summons up a prize specimen of manhood from her stable of hunky males. He sweeps you off your feet (or equivalent appendages), starts to loosen your clothing and makes the Earth (or Mars) move for you!

#message DieselEvent_M

#
#message DieselFailed

Unfortunately, you are so overwhelmed by this passionate scene that your heart just cannot take it! Shooting pains engulf your chest, you cannot breathe, your face turns blue and you suffer a very painful - and fatal - cardiac arrest. (Or the equivalent for your species.)
#
#message DieselOK

Once this passionate encounter has reached its logical climax, you are given a final and lingering kiss and told to return as soon as you have made some more money. You are left to recover from the experience in the comfort of the boudoir.

Sitting yourself in the seat you yank the lever hard. Try as you might, though, you are unable to budge it. After much sweating and heaving you give up deciding to do some weight training before returning for another try!
#
#message MN236
Sitting yourself in the seat you yank the lever hard. It swings free, but then returns to its original position with such force that the momentum sends you sprawling across the chamber! You feel somewhat bruised and battered from the whole experience.
#
#message MN237
Sitting yourself in the seat you yank the lever hard. It moves freely in your hand. As you swing it across, an orange colored force field plays over the chair and your body. You feel a sudden euphoria which is not disturbed by the sight of your wallet going up in flames. You release the lever and the play of energy ceases.
#
#message TUNING_FORK_EVENT
A squad of security guards burst into the room and seize you. "Another one," laughs the leader. "They must think we are stupid the way they keep trying the old fork trick!" Without further ado they shove you out of the airlock without your vac suit.
#
#message GMEvent
There is a shimmer of teleport effect, and you are suddenly transported into a comfortable study. Facing you is the Grand Master of the Guild of Free Traders. He congratulates you on your promotion to Trader and confirms your membership of the Guild. With that the teleporter returns you to your original destination.

#
#message TDXNotModified
The miner doesn't do anything special!
#
#message TDXModified
The miner takes the TDX and leans harder on his shovel. The TDX, he tells you, reminds him of his younger days when he was a member of a Venusian Freedom Party active cell. With a few deft movements that you don't quite follow, he explains that TDX can be modified to increase its gravity polarizing effect by an order of magnitude, making it effective against substantial targets such as government buildings. He hands the TDX back to you with a sly wink.
#
#message UseOpal
You touch the energy curtain with the opal and a section of the screen flares briefly and vanishes as the opal absorbs the energy. Before it has a chance to re-form you step through the resulting gap.
#
#message UseTDXNotModified
Placing the TDX against the outside of the cylinder near where you judge the power source is located you set the charge and trigger the fuse. There is an impressive explosion but little damage!
#
#message UseTDXNoKnowledge
Placing the TDX against the outside of the cylinder near where you judge the power source is located you set the charge and trigger the fuse. Your world disintegrates in a clap of thunder...
#
#message UseTDX1
Placing the TDX against the outside of the cylinder near where you judge the power source is located you set the fuse to give you just enough time to get back outside the defensive field and trigger the fuse...

You reach the relative safety of the road and fling yourself on the ground just before the TDX explodes. You watch as the explosion starts a chain reaction in the hull. There is a curious twisting effect and the Martian nest and the area of the crater become a sort of greenish transparency which folds up on itself.

#
#message UseTDX2
Clearly your sabotage has stopped whatever it was that is holding the Martians stable in time. Suddenly the whole Nest vanishes, leaving the downs untouched as though nothing had ever happened.

#message HorsellPuzzleLastSegment
From the crater you hear hammering, which rises to a crescendo. There is a hiss and you catch the green flicker of the heat ray. Far to the southeast you hear rumble of artillery, which is suddenly silenced by a series of explosions. Time is running short - the Martians have nearly completed their time transit receiver!

#message MartiansTimeUpInCrater
Suddenly, you notice that the Martians are starting to stir - the paralysis is starting to wear off! You race back through the defensive field and take cover in a nearby grove of trees.
#
#message MartianVictory
From the crater you hear a triumphal hooting noise - the Martians have succeeded in establishing a time link, and you have failed. Even as this registers, there is a series of green flashes as the cylinders carrying reinforcements start to fall on London. The tripod fighting machines of the Horsell Martians move out to join them...

Fortunately for you, the very nature of time travel means that you can return home and try again!
#
#message ArtillerymanNotTriggered

The artilleryman thanks you for returning his dog tag. He was part of an artillery battery that the Martians had wiped out. "We didn't stand a chance," he says. "It was a massacre. They did pause when the parson ran out and commanded them to be cast out as devils. Everything froze as he started 'The Lord is my shepherd...', but then the pause was over and he was killed too, poor devil. Nothing can stop them." He turns away.

#
#message PlayOrganSuccess
As the last note of the Psalm fades you realize that the noise from the Martian nest has also stopped. Rushing up to the Bell Tower you gaze on the scene. Below you on the common you can see the Martians stopped in the act of whatever it was they were doing when you first started playing. Your music has succeeded in paralyzing them, but for how long you wonder? Will you have time to get into the nest and destroy the whole foul set up?
#
#message PlayOrganFollowup_1

As you turn away from the window, there is a sparkle of holo effect in the corner, and the image of a high ranking naval officer appears. She is obviously extremely annoyed. "How dare you interfere with a Naval Intelligence operation," she storms. "Get yourself and all of your staff out of there immediately, and don't return without the direct permission of Naval Intelligence."

As the holo vanishes, the noise of the work breaks out again in the Martian camp. Perhaps it is time you retreated and sorted out what you're doing here!
#
#message PlayOrganFollowup_2

As you turn away from the window, there is a sparkle of holo effect in the corner, and the image of Admiral Katov appears. Her annoyance is very obvious!

Your commission in Naval Intelligence is withdrawn. Get out of there with all of your staff immediately."

#message PATROL_CHECK_OK
The patrol leader levels his laser at you and demands to see your pass. He looks at everything you are carrying and seems disappointed that he can't shoot you. "We take security very seriously here," he snarls grudgingly. "Can't be too careful." He continues to eye you with suspicion.
#
#message PATROL_CHECK_FAILED
The patrol leader levels his laser at you and demands to see your pass. When he realizes you don't have one, his face lights up with an evil smile. "I like to kill intruders," he gloats, as he pushes his laser into your face. His smile broadens as he fires the laser; as you die, the last thing you see is his leering face...

#message ORDER_PLANET_QUOTE
A salesdroid trundles over to you and humbly apologizes for the fact that they have run out of ready-made planets and can only supply worlds that need extensive modification. But as a compensation, Slarti's Planet Shop is only too willing to take the burden of having to build an Interstellar Link off your shoulders (or equivalent), at cost, with no hidden extras, if you can supply the raw materials! A screen on the front of the droid lights up, showing the cost of your purchase, as follows:

    Legal fees:            4,561,099
    Search fees:             747,000
    Deeds:                   999,999
    Surveyors' fees:         559,300
    Contingency budget:    2,000,000
    Registration:             34,000
    Sales tax:             1,098,602
    Materials:             7,138,500
    Wages/Bribes:         97,861,500

From: Directorate of Naval Intelligence
      Operations Section

The Directorate's operations against the pirate menace have recently been compromised by a high level defection. Since your commission in the Service is fairly recent it is unlikely that the pirates will know your status within the Directorate. You are therefore charged with the assignment of tracking down the pirate base and destroying it.

A nuclear missile strike has been made ready to use against the base, but before it can be used two items of information are needed - the launch code and the coordinates of the base. The coordinates you should be able to find at the base when you infiltrate it. The launch code poses more of a problem. The operative who set up the code was assassinated shortly after the defection, so you will need to track down the code for yourself. The only clue we can offer is that the deceased operative frequently disguised himself by wearing an anorak.

Before skipping, the defector wiped out many of our records relating to the pirate base so we have no current record of where it might be. We do, however, know that there are links between the pirates, the Venusian drug smugglers, and the Lunar Mafia. Your first task, therefore, will be to infiltrate the Venusian drug ring and to act as a courier between them and the Lunar Mafia. If you succeed in doing this you should receive further information about the base from the Mafia.

Be warned - if you do succeed in infiltrating the base it is likely that security will be extremely stringent. It would be unwise for you to take your own transmitter in, so you will have to seek out the pirate's transmitter to launch the missiles. There will be time between the launch and the missile strike for you to get clear of the base.

#
#message DNI_BeV
Billion electron Volt relativistic accelerator: Code-name 'BeV'
---------------------------------------------------------------

Designed to accelerate sub-meson matter components to relativistic speeds, this facility provides the 'trigger' needed to catapult matter through time. Requires considerable sustained power to provide the accelerating electric and magnetic fields.

Day to day running of the facility (e.g. for research) requires no extra inputs, but each use of plant as part of the time machine facilities will require large quantities of radioactives.

Use the DI INFO facility for construction information.
#
#message DNI_BlackBox
Black box:
   The Galactic Administration's Bureau of Espionage has a special department charged with developing devices to aid in their covert work. Headed by a shadowy figure known only by the initial 'R', its secret research labs produce many devices which later make their way onto the open market, such as spybeams and shields. The black box is a prototype device that was abandoned because of flaws in its operation.
#
#message DNI_C3
Command, control and communications facility: Code-name 'C3'
------------------------------------------------------------

Traveling through time with accuracy, and arriving in a space not already occupied requires substantial improvements in existing control and command facilities. Likewise driving communications through time as well as space is a problem orders of magnitudes more complex than normal communications.

Use the DI INFO facility for construction information.
#
#message DNI_Calendar
Calendar:
   Despite the Galactic Administration's official adoption of the stardate system, and the continual lobbying by out-of-Sol planets for calendar reform, the bulk of the population of the Galaxy persist in using the dating system of Earth, as shown by calendars found all over the Galaxy.
#
#message DNI_CauchySequence
Cauchy sequence:
   A sequence of elements in a metric space such that for any positive number no matter how small there exists a term in the sequence for which the distance between any two terms beyond this term is less than the arbitrarily small number.
#
#message DNI_Converter
N-Space Converter.
   An n-space converter can be added to spaceship engines with the 'fit' command. Ships so fitted are capable of making the transition to Hilbert Space, though at some cost to their occupants. Converters are notoriously unstable because of the high transient energy levels they operate at. The few models known rarely last more than a couple of trips before ceasing to operate, usually in a fairly spectacular manner!
   These converters are capable of distorting the very fabric of time, something which is deemed so dangerous that they are banned throughout known space.
#
#message DNI_Diamond
Diamond:
   The psionic diamond is the controller for the hydrogen fusion plant found in the Martian ruins. It can only be used properly by Commanders and Captains.
#
#message DNI_Downside
Core Tap Power Generation Facility &
Broadcast Power Receiver: Code-name 'Downside'
----------------------------------------------

This facility is designed to provide a large steady power output by tapping into the heat energy at the planet's core. A broadcast power receiver of a unique design collects power from an orbital facility (cf. 'Upside') for use as required.

When used to power the time machine facilities, large quantities of anti-matter are required because of the huge demand placed on the facility.

#
#message DNI_Hamster
Hamster:
   A small Eurasian rodent (genus Cricetus) with cheek-pouches reaching almost to the shoulder.
#
#message DNI_HGW
Time Machine: Code-name 'HGW'
-----------------------------

Time machines consist of two parts. One is a large crystalline building which is static in time and space and into which all the other time travel components feed their output. The second part is that which moves through time and space with its passenger. One static part may control several dynamic parts.

The second part resembles a terrestrial bicycle with the control board (a modified Wayne synthesizer) mounted on the handlebars. This unusual configuration has proved best able to cope with rogue time storms, and so has been adopted as standard.

#
#message DNI_HilbertSpace
Hilbert Space:
   A vector space for which a scalar product is defined and in which every Cauchy sequence composed of elements in the space converges to a limit in the space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Designed to accept huge quantities of cheap materials for transmuting into transuranic actinides and processing into the quasi-temporal crystalline objects known as 'Orsons'. Like all transmutation processes the facility requires large quantities of raw materials, and a lot of power to turn out very small quantities of output.

Use the DI INFO facility for construction information.

Day to day running of the facility (e.g. for research) requires no extra inputs, but each use of plant as part of the time machine facilities will require large quantities of soya and nitros to produce a usable quantity of Orsons.
#
#message DNI_MatTrans
Matter Transfer facility: Code-name 'MatTrans'
----------------------------------------------

Matter transfer (teleportation) is a very recent breakthrough in Imperial research. The facilities are expensive and consume a great deal of power, and thus are only available on highly developed planets. A teleportation facilities enables the use of Federation's 'teleport' command to travel round the galaxy.

Running the MatTrans facility normally requires no extra inputs, but in space-time configuration additional resources are required.

#
#message DNI_Opal
Opal:
   The item commonly referred to as the opal is not in fact an opal at all. It is the core of a Magneto-hydrodynamic generator. MHD generators are used to fire up fusion plants.
#
#message DNI_OperationOTIS
It has long been postulated that time travel of a limited nature is possible but the energy requirements were thought to be so vast as to be beyond the reach of an individual planet. However, the recent discovery of the Carter-Thoris Energy Booster has brought time travel within the reach of planets of high economic development, although the costs are so great, in monetary and in resource terms, that it can only be used sparingly.

The DNI has recently released information on a strictly confidential basis to certain of its qualified agents, enabling them to construct a time machine for use against threats to the space-time continuum. Such a device consists of a number of separate facilities, code-named Upside, Downside, MatTrans, BeV, C3, MatProc and HGW. Each of these facilities must be constructed, using vast quantities of raw materials, a high proportion of the planetary workforce, and the appropriate finance.

Once complete, the device may be operated to take one or more persons to the selected time and location. Use of the time machine requires yet more resources, which will undoubtedly be a huge burden on the already depleted planet. The commodities required for each roundtrip journey are as follows:

    Anti-matter       6,000 tons
    Monopoles         5,000 tons
    Petros            7,000 tons
    Xmetals           3,400 tons
    Crystals          5,000 tons
    Radioactives      8,000 tons
    Soya             16,000 tons
    Nitros           10,000 tons

Users are warned that each journey through time may damage some of the facilities of the time machine, which must be repaired before it can be safely used again.
#
#message DNI_Orsonite
Orsonite:
   A titanium/orson alloy of incredible hardness. Most of the extant samples have been found in the Martian ruins. A number of artifacts made of this substance lie in the ruins, but they have so far resisted attempts to cut off small samples for analysis.
   The process by which orsons are stabilized to make the metal has not yet been replicated, although the free orsons themselves can be manufactured, and are, indeed, an essential part of the time travelling process.
   An analysis of the crystalline structure of the alloy indicates that artifacts made of this substance may have some instability in the presence of gravity polarized disturbances, but this is still a matter of some dispute. What is clear, however, is that this alloy is immune to the effects of chrono-storms, making it an ideal substance for building time machines, if it can be replicated.

Selena waves goodbye. "You can call me for a tour at any time; just go to Earth's landing pad and from your command center, type TOUR." She blows you a kiss and vanishes.

#
#message Tour1

An attractive young woman in a space suit appears on your viewscreen. "Hi, I'm Selena of the Spaceways and I am your tour guide for today," she says, raising the glass she is holding in a salute. "I will take you on a tour of Federation DataSpace and show you some of the exciting things that await you in the future."

Selena smiles at you and adjusts her space helmet. "The tour takes about 15 minutes, but you can stop it at any time by typing QUIT. While you are on the tour, you won't be able to talk to anyone else in Federation Dataspace -- I demand your undivided attention." Selena grins cheekily.

#
#message Tour2
"Let's visit Mars first, home of Chez Diesel, the Social Center of the Solar System -- the best bar in the Galaxy. I'm going to take control of your space ship, so just sit back and enjoy the ride."

You settle into the pilot's couch and the console comes to life. The comms crackle, "{%s}, you are cleared for lift off."
There is a surge of power, and the viewscreen clears...
Earth orbit
   You are in orbit round the earth. A lump comes into your throat as you gaze at the misty blue-green surface, with its white cloud masses. Few are unaffected by the sight of mankind's home planet.

#
#message Tour3
Selena says, "If you are flying your own ship, you just type ORBIT to take off, and use the compass directions to move about just like you do on the ground. But you don't have to do anything now, I'm in control."

Interplanetary space
   Looking at the screen you discover that you are in a sector which is totally devoid of planets.

Mars orbit
   You are in geosynchronous orbit above Mars's main spaceport. From orbit the surface appears an almost unrelieved dusty red, with occasional gray outcrops.

#
#message Tour4
You feed the co-ordinates into the computer, and it lands the ship. Rising from the couch you glance around...
Command center
The screen shows a view of Mars's Space Port.

The image of Selena on your viewscreen grins cheerfully. "I'll meet you on the landing pad," she says.

Mars landing area
   This is the landing area of Marsport. The landing area is in the northwest corner of the spaceport.

Your spaceship and 3 others are berthed here.
Your tour guide, Selena is here.

#
#message Tour5
As you get out of your ship Selena greets you with a friendly wave. "Let's go to Chez Diesel," she says. You follow her up the road, through Marsport, to the bar.

Chez Diesel (Social Center of the Solar System)
   A haven from the rough spaceport outside, this exclusive bar is quite the trendiest place to be, catering for all species so long as they dress well. People come here as much for the company as for the food and drink.
   The room buzzes with conversation and laughter. Alert waitdroids bustle around making sure the customers' needs are fulfilled.
   The walls are lined with large leafy plants, providing lots of secluded alcoves for private groups. The center of the room is dominated by an ornate fountain, gushing pink water up into the ceiling.
   In the background a four-armed Arcturian pianist quietly plays requests.

Diesel leans casually against the wall, baseball bat swinging idly to and fro.
A battered honky-tonk piano sits in the corner.

#
#message Tour6
Selena introduces you to Diesel, the proprieteuse of the bar. "Normally, you can't get into Chez Diesel until you have bought yourself a decent outfit, but because you're with me they have made an exception." She winks at you.

Selena has bought you a drink!

"When you want to buy yourself clothes you can visit Tux Deluxe, the clothes shop on Mars, or the clothes market on Earth. You really do need to get some trendy duds, because this changes what people see when they look at you." She twirls around, letting you examine her:

Selena of the Spaceways is wearing the only vac suit in existence that has high heels! She holds a glass in one hand, containing a drink that is bright pink and full of bubbles which keep floating out of the glass into the air.

#
#message Tour7
Drifting past you, Krystal the Muse has entered the room. She is engaged on her eternal task -- gathering in the gossip for the micro-community! She looks knowingly at you and whispers into a recorder.

Selena says, "You find characters like Krystal all over Federation DataSpace. They move about, doing their own thing, and don't pay much attention to you. Most of them will buy items from you, and some of them are looking for something in particular and will pay you a lot of money if you give it to them."

#
#message Tour8
"There are some scary, dangerous ruins on Mars -- let me show you. I have a teleporter that can whisk us straight to where we want to go."

Selena takes your hand and with a shimmer, you find yourself somewhere else...

Map room
   This very large room has one wall completely given over to a huge map of the whole complex.
   Most of the map is still there, though bits have faded, but since you can't read Martian, you can't find the "You Are Here" sign. Consequently, the map is not much use to you.
   There are exits to the north and northwest.

A marsrat snarls at you in an aggressive fashion. As you step nearer to it, the marsrat bares its teeth. Very sharp, chisel-like teeth they are too! You suddenly lose interest in examining the marsrat...

Selena pulls you away from the marsrat. "Nasty things -- they spread all kinds of virulent Martian diseases."

#
#message Tour9
"Sometimes you find very valuable things in Federation..."

Treasure room
   You are standing in the middle of a room whose walls appear to be made of pure gold! Unfortunately, there is no way that you can get a purchase to strip the metal off the wall.
   In the middle of the room is a black marble block topped by a white pedestal. The top of the pedestal is chalice shaped. The room continues to the east.

A very fine opal is lying on the floor.

Selena has picked up the opal. "Take a look at this!" she says.

The opal is about the size of your fist -- even the Venusian mines don't produce jewels this big! Your mind has difficulty grasping the likely value of such a jewel...

Selena has dropped the opal.

#
#message Tour10
"Teleporters are very useful gadgets," Selena says. "You'll be able to build yourself one, when you reach the rank of Baron."

Altar
   You are standing in front of the church's main altar. Hanging above the altar is the biggest holo you have ever seen, depicting a white, square room whose walls have been disfigured by some red stains.
   There is an opening in the front of the altar, from which stairs lead down into darkness.

"If you're wondering what those red stains are... you don't want to know." Selena shudders delicately.

#
#message Tour11
"Now let me show you some of the other planets in the Solar System. There's some interesting places on the moon, including a casino where you can gamble on the roulette wheel."

Casino
   You are in a casino. Some of the tables are available for use by non-members!
   The exit is northwest, and there is a bar to the west.

A roulette wheel on which you can gamble trader credits awaits you.

Selena decides to gamble on black. She lays down the chips representing her stake and the croupier droid spins the wheel...
The ball clatters noisily round the wheel, slows down, and finally comes to rest on the RED.
Dejectedly she watches her stake being raked into the house's already large pile...

#
#message Tour12
Selena smiles ruefully. "Oh well, only a fool gambles what they can't afford to lose. Come on, {%s}, let me show you some more places on the moon."

Viewing Lounge
   You are in the colony's viewing area. Through the roof of the dome you can see the blue-green crescent of the waning Earth. To the west a pleasant cafe beckons.
   East is the dome's entrance, south and southeast the viewing area continues, and to the northeast is an expanse of grass.

Zero-gravity arena
   You are standing in the balcony of the zero-gravity arena. In the arena two teams of wrestlers are straining to get in touch with one another! The exit is east.

#
#message Tour13
"The moon is run by gangsters, you know. Some of the people here are a bit scary."

Mario's
   Mario's bar is very seedy, and looks as though it is the hang out for the moon's criminal fraternity... The exit is east should you need to make a quick getaway!

You recognize the man sitting at one of the tables as Mario the Knife.

The man has just finished carving his name -- Mario -- in one of the tables with a wicked looking flick knife..

"He's very touchy. You do NOT want to get on the wrong side of Mario. He works for the Godfather." Selena looks around to make sure no-one can hear. She whispers, "He's all mixed up in the drugs trade. Not very nice at all. We'd better go."

#
#message Tour14
"Castillo is one of the moons of the planet Jupiter. No-one lives on Jupiter, you can't land a ship there. Not a lot happens on Castillo, it's just a research station."

Fedruckers
   This large bar is decorated in garish yellow and bright blue, with rows of tables filled with raucous diners.
   Hordes of small children, many of them green and some with tentacles, cluster around the latest arcade machine, 'Martian Invasion', which makes the most peculiar hooting and hammering noises. This makes it hard to hear the names being called over the loudspeaker.

Selena has bought you a Mega-Burger!

"Many people think this place should be called Callisto, not Castillo... but can we help it if generations of astronomers have got it wrong?" Selena shrugs.

#
#message Tour15
"Titan is another moon, this time of Saturn. It has some spectacular scenery."

Titan surface
   You are standing at the top of the breathtaking Krzesinski cliff, which drops away to your east. South lies the landing area.

"But not much else... it's mainly one big manufacturing plant."

Processing room
   The room is filled with noisy machinery from which conveyor belts run out through hatches in the walls.

#
#message Tour16
Selena puts her fingers in her ears to block out the noise, then operates her teleporter to move you onwards.

Laboratory
   You are in a small, well-equipped laboratory used for analyzing ore samples. The door is in the west wall.

A crumpled chart lies on the ground by your feet.

Selena picks it up and shows it to you. The chart contains all the details of the planned output of the Titan Mines during the next period. This information COULD be worth a lot...

"You find lots of objects lying around. If you can figure out who really wants them, you can get a lot of groats for them." She drops the chart again.

#
#message Tour17
"This is Titan's exchange," says Selena. "Oh, did I tell you about trading exchanges? Every planet has one, it's where goods are bought and sold by the trading ranks."

Market
   You are standing in the colony's market. Across the far wall a massive electronic ticker-tape displays the prices of goods as they become available.
   There are exits to the north, the west and the northwest.

+++ The display shows new prices for Lubricating Oils +++
+++ Exchange buys at 462 IG/ton +++

"You can make big bucks trading if you know what you are doing."

"On Mercury, there's a place which will terraform planets to your very own specification. When you reach the rank of Explorer you can design your own planet, for others to visit."

Corridor
   You are at the north end of a rock-lined corridor. There is a shop to the northeast, and a door to the west. Above the door hangs a holographic sign showing a slowly rotating planet.

Selena leads you through the door...

#
#message Tour19
Slarti's Construction and Design Workshop
   The planet shop is like a TARDIS, far bigger on the inside; it opens out into a vast cavernous space in which pieces of world are being moved around by enormous construction machines. High above you hang mountains ready to be positioned and sprayed with snow.
   Construction droids trundle around, moving vast pieces of continent into position, while smaller designer droids fuss over the exact placement of delicate details such as trees and rivers. One is carefully chiseling pieces off a coastline, creating lots of fiddly little fjords for which it hopes to win an award.
   A large notice on the wall informs prospective customers of the rules and regulations which require a builder's permit. It also tells you to type <ORDER> to see the catalogue of currently available planets.
   A door in the west wall leads to the workbench where purchasers can customize their planets. The exit is east.

#
#message Tour20
"Mercury has an extensive cave system that you can easily get lost in, but there are some valuable things to be found there, so long as you can avoid the fierce beasts."

Tunnel
   You are in a wide rock lined tunnel, which runs in an east/west direction.

A grizzle hunter stalks past you.

The hunter barely notices you, so intent is he on stalking his prey. You notice, however, that he hesitates slightly about which way to go when he reaches a junction.

Selena says, "Like many of the characters in Federation, the hunter wants something specific; if you work out what it is, he'll give you good groats for it."

#
#message Tour21
Grizzle's lair
   You've walked into a grizzle's lair... The exit is north, if you survive to use it!

A grizzle approaches you ponderously...

Imagine an 18-foot high grizzly bear with razor sharp claws, and a spiked, lizard-like tail... This is a rough approximation of the grizzle. Closer examination would be unwise!

Selena squeals, "Whoops! I think we'll move rapidly on..." She operates her teleporter fast.

#
#message Tour22
"This is Venus... famous for its mining operations. Very valuable minerals and precious stones get dug up here." Selena shows you her earrings, made from Venusian firestones.

Museum
   You are in the northeast corner of the museum. This area is devoted to Venus.
   Under the cases are examples of the fabulous gems for which the planet is famous, and the exotic, hallucinogen producing, plant life.

"We can take the shuttle to the mines." She leads you down a slideway to the station and into the waiting shuttle.

#
#message Tour23
Shuttle
   You are sitting in the carriage of the shuttle. Along each side of the carriage is benching, and in the middle is room for standing passengers.

The shuttle doors close. There is a smooth and rapid acceleration. The rock walls swish hypnotically past until, with a start, you realize that you are pulling into a station. A disembodied voice says, "MIND THE GAP!" The doors slide open and you can see the platform of the West Mines station

#
#message Tour24
"This is our stop!" Selena hops off the shuttle and leads you deep into the mine.

Workings
   This seems to be one of the main workings in the mine, though it is deserted at the moment. In the dim light you can see mounds of rubble from which gems have been (mostly) extracted.
   The face of the workings lies to your north, while an unlit corridor leads off to the southwest.

A bent, old miner leans on his shovel.

You examine the miner. The miner bears your scrutiny patiently, and looks back at you with piercing blue eyes that make you feel uncomfortable.

#
#message Tour25
"There are bits of these mines that no-one is supposed to go. Be very quiet and I'll show you."

Drug processing
   This is the area in which the harvested plants are processed into a variety of drugs. The machinery is not in use at the moment. There is an exit to the south, and a door to the northeast.

"The Imperial Navy would love to see this operation closed down! They'll recruit you to help fight the drug cartels, when you get to a high enough rank to be useful to them."

#
#message Tour26
"You started out on Earth, so already know some of it. But there are some secret bits that THEY don't want you to see until you're at a much higher rank... let's sneak in anyway!" She giggles and activates her teleporter, taking you into Earth's Naval Base.

Parade ground
   You are at the southeast corner of the parade ground. In the middle of this section is a flag pole from which the Imperial banner floats in the breeze.
   To your east is the sensor array of the base's radar unit, while to the south is the entrance to the control tower.

A squad of marines marches past. They all look pretty burly -- not to be tangled with stuff... As you look the sergeant shouts "Eyes Right" and salutes you.

#
#message Tour27
"The Imperial Navy have some very high-tech stuff in here."

Laser control
   This is the command center for all of the base's close-in laser defenses. Control panels for the operators of each battery line one of the walls, while fire-control consoles are placed at intervals behind them.
   A huge projected display of the base and starport fills much of the remaining area. There is a door in the west wall.

#
#message Tour28
"If you take assignments from the Navy, you'll get to visit some very dangerous places. Let's take a swift look at an asteroid base used by pirates."

Surface
   You are wandering around the surface of the asteroid. To your east the ground becomes more broken, to the north is an abrupt drop into a deep ravine. To the south your way is blocked by a scarred and battered concrete wall.

Reactor room
   You are on the floor of the reactor room. The reactor's pile towers above you, and close inspection reveals that it is in dire need of a service.
   A Geiger counter on the wall is showing an unhealthily high radiation reading. The way out is up to the north.

#
#message Tour29
"If you turn out to be a successful operative for the Navy, they may ask you to undertake even more dangerous missions. You will have to build a time machine, so you can go back in time to defeat a Martian invasion. Let me show you." Selena operates her time machine and timewarps you back...

Graveyard
   You are standing at the western end of a quiet graveyard. A small gate opens onto a path in the northwest. You wander among the headstones drinking in the peacefulness.

The Express pub
   You are in the tiny bar of The Express pub. There are no customers, though the empty glasses on some of the tables suggest that there have been some in there recently. All the walls have pictures of steam engines on them. The door is west.

A jolly looking publican polishes his counter.

#
#message Tour30
"This is the village of Horsell, in England. It's very green and pleasant, but it's under threat of invasion that could change the course of our history."

Cylinder
   You are standing at the rear of the cylinder. It is totally featureless, and you can gain no indication of its original means of propulsion. The front of the cylinder is to your west.

"I think we'd better go, before we're discovered here. One day, you'll be coming back here to try and defeat the invasion." Selena operates her time machine and takes you back to the time where you belong.

#
#message Tour31
"When you promote to the rank of Captain, you can use the Interstellar Link to travel outside the solar system, to other planets that are owned by players. Here, let me take you to some of them."

Selena leads you back to your ship and takes control of it again. You sit back and watch your viewscreen as she takes the ship to the Interstellar Link.

Solar system interstellar link
   You are in a tight orbit around the beacon indicating the presence of an interstellar hyperspace link. In the center of your screen is the pulsing blue circle that indicates the link entry.
   The beacon itself is a white duo-decahedron covered with transmission aerials.

#
#message Tour32
As your ship makes the jump nausea washes over you and you feel weak and faint. Your vision blurs and you have to force yourself to look at the changed star pattern on your viewscreen...

Interstellar Link and Planetary Orbit
   The planet which spins in your viewscreen is completely encased in ice. It looks like a snowball fashioned by a giant. It sparkles as it slowly rotates, the light of the distant sun reflecting off the icy surface, making it hard to look at the world for too long without getting dazzled.
   Better turn the heating up... it's cold down there!

Your ship lands and you disembark.

#
#message Tour33
Selena is there on the landing pad.

Landing Pad
   Huge drifts of snow and banks of solid ice enclose the field, but they don't keep the bitter wind out. Igloos -- small buildings fashioned from blocks of ice -- house the planet's essential services. Southwest is the trading exchange, east is the hospital and a bar which serves lovely warming drinks is south. Northeast, a break in the ice bank lets you venture out onto the frozen wastes of the planet.

Your tour guide, Selena is here.

#
#message Tour34
"Brrrr, it's cold here, isn't it {%s}? Let's find the bar."

Snow Queen's Hostel
   This hostel's owner, an elegant albino man, smiles a welcome to you and offers you a steaming mug of what passes for coffee on this planet.
   There's a roaring fire in the center of this igloo, making it warm enough for the natives to remove at least the outer layers of their clothing... but the fire doesn't melt the icy walls. Very clever!
   A native woman sits in the corner stitching furs together into clothing.

Selena has bought you a cup of hot spiced wine!

#
#message Tour35
"Let's go somewhere a bit warmer." Selena's teleporter whisks you away to another planet on the other side of the Galaxy.

Temple Spring
   A burbling spring flows out of a rock face here into a low trough. Simple cups attached to long sticks are here from which to drink and rinse the dust from your hands.

Temple Garden
   You stroll through an elegant garden of stones set among carefully raked gravel paths. A few monks stand contemplating the tortured stone shapes and the twisted evergreen trees that grow here. A high stone wall rises to the East, with a small portal secured by an intricate lock. Paths lead North and West.

"This is the planet Nikko. The gardens here are an ideal place to relax."

#
#message Tour36
"Something more lively... Pacifica, a planet with an oriental flavor."

Edo City Karaoke Bar
   The well-lit bar is in the center of the room, around which patrons nurse their drinks. Someone is singing an old Karaoke song on the raised platform at the far end of the bar.
   Stairs lead to the exclusive section of the bar, where only the upper crust of society are allowed. A stairway leading down to the more raucous part of the nightclub is guarded by a large man with a tattoo.

#
#message Tour37
"This is the planet Rift, which is great fun to explore."

Hanger   [ Centrum - N ]
   You have entered a large room with a high ceiling. The occasional whine from anti-grav and repulsor units of the arriving/departing ships can be heard. A large number of scout and exploration craft seem to be berthed here, as well as a few of obvious alien design. Small service bays off the main hanger hold fuel and water resupply lines, power feed units, and tools for minor repairs. The main entrance lies north. Northwest, large bay doors lead to the shipyard. The landing pad is south.
   You notice a man standing in front of an open access panel. Sparks emanate from the circuitry within and you smell burning wiring. He is frantically shouting "Shut it off, Shut it off!" to his co-pilot.

#
#message Tour38
"Finally, we'll go on a fishing trip to Trout."

Fly Fishing Hall of Fame
   As your eyes adjust to the light, you notice a floor with plush forest green carpeting. There are mahogany benches along the walls. A crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling.
   Atop a center table sits a humidor of fine Cuban cigars. A cut glass decanter of single malt Scotch whisky is next to it. This anteroom leads to the award room which is southwest.

Rules and Regulations Room
   In plain view, a large poster declares:
1) Fishing license required
2) Proper equipment required
3) Camping allowed only in designated areas
4) Fires allowed only within fire rings
5) Fishing is inherently a safe sport....but the management assumes no responsibility for careless acts

#
#message Tour39
"There are lots of planets outside the Solar System, all designed and owned by players -- far too many for me to show you now!"

Selena shows you a list of the hundreds of planets you can visit. "Planets come and go all the time so you may not be able to visit the out-of-Sol planets I have shown you -- but there are sure to be many interesting places for you to explore."

Selena operates her teleporter for the last time and takes you back to Earth's landing pad.

"Well, that's the end of the tour. I hope you have enjoyed this jaunt around Federation DataSpace, and that it's given you an idea of some of the things you have to look forward to. You can take this tour again any time you like -- just go to Earth's landing pad and from the command center, type TOUR. I'll be along to show you around again."

Selena blows you a kiss, and with a cheery wave of her glass of pink bubbly she leaves you. You get back into your ship.

#
#message SolLocation1
Command center
   You are in the ship's control center. Most of the forward bulkhead is taken up by a large viewscreen. Under the screen is the pilot's seat, and to the right is the output from the battle computer and the weaponry controls. To the left is the communications panel.
   South is a hatch leading to the access corridor, while a door leads to the southwest.
#
#message SolLocation2
Access corridor
   You are in a drably-painted access corridor that runs along the ship's north/south axis. To the northeast is the airlock, east is the galley, and southeast is the engine room.
   At the south end is a hatch leading to the cargo bay, while the command center is at the north end.
#
#message SolLocation3
Galley
   You are in a cramped but serviceable galley, with an exit hatch to the west.
#
#message SolLocation4
Airlock
   You are in the ship's airlock. To one side is a rack for hanging space suits. There are two exits - one marked 'IN' and the other marked 'OUT'!
#
#message SolLocation5
Engine room
   Huge panels filled with dials, gauges, and meters tell you everything you want to know about the power output of your engine. Access panels slide back easily to let you get into the guts of the engine if you need to make modifications or repairs.
   You think you hear a faint voice saying, 'The engines canna take it, Captain!' but of course it must be your imagination.
#
#message SolLocation6
Living quarters
   You are in a fairly bare living quarters. The essentials are all here, but little else. The whole room could do with refurbishing and a touch of luxury adding to it.
#
#message SolLocation7
Sleeping quarters
   You are in the pilot's sleeping quarters. A snug bunk fills most of the space but there is also a small wash unit in one corner.
#
#message SolLocation8
Cargo bay
   You are standing in the cargo bay. This vast, echoing space holds all of your cargo and munitions. To the north lies the hatch to the rest of the ship.
   South you can just make out the outline of the cargo doors - but they can only be operated from outside the ship.
#
#message SolLocation9
Solar system interstellar link
   You are in a tight orbit around the beacon indicating the presence of an interstellar hyperspace link. In the center of your screen is the pulsing blue circle that indicates the link entry.
   The beacon itself is a white dodecahedron covered with transmission aerials.
#
#message SolLocation10
Interplanetary space
   You are in interplanetary space. The instrumentation report indicates that there are no planets in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation11
Saturn orbit
   You are in orbit above the planet Saturn. Beneath you, the planet appears a dim, sickly yellow. From this altitude the planet's rings are not visible, but the debris that makes them up is very much in evidence!
#
#message SolLocation12
Titan orbit
   You are in orbit above the frozen surface of Titan. In the background you can see Saturn, with its spectacular system of rings.
#
#message SolLocation13
Interplanetary space
   The unwinking stars look down on you as you travel between planets, of which there are none in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation14
Interplanetary space
   This sector is empty of planets. Dwarfed by the immensity of space, you brood on the insignificance of all human endeavor...
#
#message SolLocation15
Interplanetary space
   This sector is totally devoid of planets.
#
#message SolLocation16
Interplanetary space
   The instruments tell you that there are no planets in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation17
Interplanetary space
   A quick scan of the sector is enough to tell you that there are no planets in this area.
#
#message SolLocation18
Interplanetary space
   Looking at the screen, which shows that there are no planets in this sector, you wonder what it is that makes you go on...
#
#message SolLocation19
Interplanetary space
   Once again, you are in the empty space between planets...
#
#message SolLocation20
Interplanetary space
   No planets in this sector, your instruments tell you.
#
#message SolLocation21
Castillo orbit
   You are in orbit above the cratered surface of Castillo. The bulk of Jupiter can be seen round the edge of the tiny moon.
#
#message SolLocation22
Interplanetary space
   No planets in this area. The emptiness feels oppressive, but you shrug it off with a wry smile.
#
#message SolLocation23
Interplanetary space
   You check the instruments, but there are no planets in this segment of space.
#
#message SolLocation24
Jupiter orbit
   You are in orbit round the planet Jupiter. Beneath you the planet's noxious and liquid atmosphere swirls angrily. As you watch the Great Red Spot swims into the corner of your viewscreen.
#
#message SolLocation25
Interplanetary space
   Your instrument readings indicate a complete absence of planets in this sector of space.
#
#message SolLocation26
Interplanetary space
   The printout indicates nothing in the way of planets in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation27
Interplanetary space
   There is a distinct absence of planets in this sector, your instruments tell you. You scowl and kick the console for good measure!
#
#message SolLocation28
Interplanetary space
   You are in space between planets. Your instruments indicate that there are no planets in this sector of space.
#
#message SolLocation29
Interplanetary space
   The unwinking stars look down on you as you travel between planets. There are no planets in this sector of space.
#
#message SolLocation30
Interplanetary space
   This sector is empty of any planets. Dwarfed by the immensity of space, you brood on your own insignificance.
#
#message SolLocation31
Mars orbit
   You are in geosynchronous orbit above Mars's main spaceport. From orbit the surface appears an almost unrelieved dusty red, with occasional gray outcrops.
#
#message SolLocation32
Interplanetary space
   Looking at the screen you discover that you are in a sector which is totally devoid of planets.
#
#message SolLocation33
Interplanetary space
   The instruments tell you that there are no planets in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation34
Interplanetary space
   A quick scan is enough to tell you that there are no planets in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation35
Interplanetary space
   Looking at the screen, which shows no planets in this sector, you wonder what it is that makes you go on.
#
#message SolLocation36
Interplanetary space
   You are in the vast empty spaces between the planets.
#
#message SolLocation37
Interplanetary space
   No planets in this sector, your instruments tell you. Somehow, it seems awfully lonely here...
#
#message SolLocation38
Interplanetary space
   No planets here. The emptiness feels oppressive, but you shrug off the feeling and go back to reading an Anne McCaffrey book.
#
#message SolLocation39
Earth orbit
   You are in orbit round the earth. A lump comes into your throat as you gaze at the misty blue-green surface, with its white cloud masses. Few are unaffected by the sight of mankind's home planet.
#
#message SolLocation40
Interplanetary space
   You check your screens, but there are no planets in this part of space. With a shrug you turn to other tasks of shipboard maintenance.
#
#message SolLocation41
Interplanetary space
   Instrument readings indicate a complete absence of planets in this sector of space.
#
#message SolLocation42
Interplanetary space
   The printout indicates nothing in the way of planets in this sector.
#
#message SolLocation43
Interplanetary space
   Nothing in the way of planets in this sector, guv!
#
#message SolLocation44
Interplanetary space
   You are in space between the planets. Your instruments report that there are no planets in this sector of space.
#
#message SolLocation45
Interplanetary space
   The unwinking stars look down on you as you go about your business of traveling between the planets.
#
#message SolLocation46
Interplanetary space
   This sector is empty. You brood on the immensity of space, as it weighs down on you.
#
#message SolLocation47
Lunar orbit
   You are in stationary orbit over the Moon's spaceport, Selena. From this angle it certainly doesn't look as though the Moon is made of green cheese!
#
#message SolLocation48
Interplanetary space
   Your main viewscreen shows you that there are no planets in this vicinity, just empty space.
#
#message SolLocation49
Interplanetary space
   The instruments tell you that there are no planets in this sector of space.
#
#message SolLocation50
Venus orbit
   You are in orbit around the planet Venus. All you can see are the dense white clouds that protected its secrets for so long.
#
#message SolLocation51
Interplanetary space
   A quick scan of the sector is all you need to tell you that there are no planets here.
#
#message SolLocation52
Interplanetary space
   Gazing at the empty vista in the main viewscreen, you wish you were back on Earth.
#
#message SolLocation53
Interplanetary space
   No planets in this sector, the printout tells you...
#
#message SolLocation54
Interplanetary space
   No planets here! The emptiness feels almost solid, as though you could grasp it. You smile gently, and go back to the tasks of running the spaceship.
#
#message SolLocation55
Interplanetary space
   You check the main viewscreen, but there are no planets in scanning range.
#
#message SolLocation56
Interplanetary space
   Instrument readings indicate a distinct lack of planets in this sector!
#
#message SolLocation57
Interplanetary space
   The sector you are in is devoid of planets.
#
#message SolLocation58
Interplanetary space
   No planets in this sector, your instruments tell you cheerfully! You kick the console for good measure...
#
#message SolLocation59
Interplanetary space
   You are traveling through space between the planets.
#
#message SolLocation60
Mercury orbit
   You are in orbit above Mercury. Looking down at its radiation-seared surface, you wonder why anyone bothers living on it.
#
#message SolLocation61
Interplanetary space
   You are in space near the sun. All the viewscreens on that side of the ship have been polarized to cut down the radiation.
#
#message SolLocation62
Interplanetary space
   You are fairly near the sun, while not actually in solar orbit. Even from this distance it doesn't look a very nice place!
#
#message SolLocation63
Solar orbit
   You are in orbit round the sun, which is to the southeast. The ship's refrigeration equipment is laboring noisily under the strain.
#
#message SolLocation64
Solar orbit
   You are in orbit around the sun. Not a good place to be! The sun lies to the south of your current position.
#
#message SolLocation65
Solar orbit
   You are uncomfortably close to the sun, which is to the southwest of you. Most of your instrument readings have gone into the red.
#
#message SolLocation66
Interplanetary space
   You are swanning around in space between the sun and the orbit of Mercury. Not a very wise thing to do, I would have thought, but then who am I to criticize!
#
#message SolLocation67
Solar orbit
   You are in orbit about the sun. Hungry prominences reach toward you from the photosphere. The sun is east of you.
#
#message SolLocation68
Solar surface
   Your incautious instructions send the ship plunging toward the surface of the sun. Desperately you wrestle with the controls in an effort to break away... Too late!
   Before you even have time to think a last thought the refrigeration equipment gives up the uneven struggle, and you are fried to a crisp!
#
#message SolLocation69
Solar orbit
   You are in orbit rather too close to the sun for comfort... The sun lies to the west of your current position.
#
#message SolLocation70
Lift
   You are in a small lift. Through the door you can see the reception area of the Castillo base. The lift will take you up to the surface, if you wish.
#
#message SolLocation71
Office
   You are standing in the middle of an office. There is a single desk, and all the usual office paraphernalia. The door is in the east wall.
#

Chez Diesel (Social Center of the Solar System)
   A haven from the rough spaceport outside, this exclusive bar is quite the trendiest place to be, catering for all species so long as they dress well. People come here as much for the company as for the food and drink.
   The room buzzes with conversation and laughter. Alert waitdroids bustle around making sure the customers' needs are fulfilled.
   The walls are lined with large leafy plants, providing lots of secluded alcoves for private groups. The center of the room is dominated by an ornate fountain, gushing pink water up into the ceiling.
   In the background a four-armed Arcturian pianist quietly plays requests.

Your instruments report that the navy cutter Xerxes is in the sector.
You are suitably impressed by the twin-laser turret and the missile racks...

The Vega is an 800 ton merchant ship. You can't see any weapons, but that doesn't mean to say that she's unarmed!

A crumpled chart lies on the ground by your feet.
The chart contains all the details of the planned output of the Titan Mines during the next period. This information COULD be worth a lot...

Through the transparent resin of the sealed packet you can see a number of highly dangerous and illegal drugs - including a small amount of the semi-legendary Bloodhype.
#
#message Spanner
A very heavy and solid-looking monkey wrench has been propped against the wall.
The monkey wrench is extremely heavy, and judging by the bloodstains on one end, has been used as a weapon at some time in the past!
#

You spot a magnificent old hunter watch lying in the corner.
The watch is a truly magnificent specimen of a hunter. The brass case is green with age, but the watch still keeps excellent time.

Yes! It really is a chocolate ginger cookie!

A political manifesto lies trodden on the floor.
The manifesto seems to be calling for the political emancipation of all the planets of the Solar system. They even seem to want to give men the vote!

The oscilloscope is a marvel of miniaturization. It unfolds to give a full size screen, and can cope with signals at astonishingly high frequencies.

A very pretty map has been painted onto an oiled silk cloth.
The map looks vaguely familiar but, try as you might, you can't place the region that it depicts.
#
#message Photograph

A closer examination reveals that it is a picture of two well-known Federation personalities caught flagrante delicto by the camera! Very careless of them to leave it here!

The kalindra is a beautifully worked example, inlaid with urthyarn and carefully polished. As you press its keys it emits a series of melodic notes.

It is a share certificate from the Great Western Railway. Its identification number is {%s} and it belongs to a Mr. R. Sedgewick.
#
#message Diamond
The facets of a roughly cut diamond gleam in the light.
The diamond has been roughly cut, which makes an evaluation of its worth a little difficult. It seems unflawed, and relatively pure, so you could hope for a reasonable sale.
#
#message Coat
An old coat lies in a discarded heap on the floor.
The coat is old and worn, but serviceable for someone who has nothing else suitable.
#
#message Pearls
A broken string of pearls has fallen onto the floor.
The pearls seem genuine enough - none of your mum's popper-beads here! But who could they belong to???
#
#message Sargeur
A fine example of a Martian sargeur has been left here.
The sargeur seems to be in working order, but it lacks the proper power pack needed to fire it up. An expert would know how to fit one.
#
#message Sargeur_Activated
You see a working example of a Martian sargeur.
The sargeur has had its power pack installed, and is in full working order!
#
#message Opal
A very fine opal is lying on the floor.
The opal is about the size of your fist - even the Venusian mines don't produce jewels this big! Your mind has difficulty grasping the likely value of such a jewel...
#
#message Sandwich
Someone has dropped a sandwich on the floor.
British Rail circa 1978 from the look of the curling bread! You would have to be very hungry to eat it...
#

Looks like it's for the centimetric waveband. It's still in its original packaging, as though it's just been removed from a storeroom.

You see a middle-aged woman who is obviously totally bored with you and yours, and who has seen it all before.

Someone has dropped a paperback novel.
Looking at the cover you are astounded to discover that in this day and age Mills & Boon are still in business!

A zlitherworm eyes you balefully.
Don't be silly, no one gets close enough to a zlitherworm to examine it and survives!
#
#message Official
A bored-looking official on the other side of the counter ignores you.
The official is a typical example of the Earth bureaucracy - gray and underpaid. He is always on the lookout for a way to make a fast groat on the side!
#
#message Calendar
A calendar hangs on the wall.
It looks like a pretty ordinary office-type calendar - month to a page, set at last month because no one got round to turning it over, and lots of boring, 'scenic' pictures...
#
#message Godot
Godot is waiting here!
Godot is sitting at a table passing the time of day...
#

A gnarled watchman sits here.
The watchman is sitting in a little hut near the perimeter fence. He has an open brazier on which he is roasting chestnuts and warming his hands.

The foreman is clutching an empty clipboard and frantically searching his pockets for a document. He is not having much success at finding whatever it is he's looking for.

#
#message Storeman
A storeman wanders past, picking out various items from a list he carries.
As you watch he comes to an item which is obviously not there. He hunts for it in all the surrounding shelves, but to no avail. Making a mark on his list he continues with the rest of the items.
#
#message Marsrat
A marsrat snarls at you in an aggressive fashion.
As you step nearer to it, the marsrat bares its teeth. Very sharp, chisel-like teeth they are too! You suddenly lose interest in examining the marsrat...
#
#message Cleaner
A robot cleaner is going about its business.
A power pickup and some rather dangerous-looking manipulators extrude from the front of the machine.
#
#message Rabbit
A white rabbit hurries past you.
It's a rather large white rabbit, and it seems to be wearing a waistcoat, but that must be a trick of the flickering light in these ruins...
#
#message Dog
A savage-looking German Shepherd dog gets to its feet as you enter...
You decide that you would have to get too close if you wanted to examine the dog...
#

The butler looks down his nose at you.
The butler has a classical profile, with a nose which is extremely suitable for looking down! He is doing so at this very moment...
#
#message Boy
A small boy whizzes past you, almost knocking you over.
He is moving too fast for you to be able to examine him!
#

A tourist barges past, banging your ankles with his lunar croquet mallet.
A typical tourist - shorts and a florid complexion. He is loaded up to the gills with every imaginable useless item.

The hobo is shivering as the wind whistles through the holes in the very old coat that he is wearing.

You can't see much of the technician, because she is halfway into the unit she is repairing. She looks very harassed!

As immortalized by the Bonzo Dog Do Dah Band! (Listen to the record if you want the rest of the description...)

The hunter barely notices you, so intent is he on stalking his prey. You notice, however, that he hesitates slightly about which way to go when he reaches a junction.
#
#message Tinguey
A tinguey rolls gently past you.
Sensing your scrutiny, the tinguey tinkles its branches (?) at you in a conversational fashion. When you fail to respond it continues on its way.
#
#message Weeble
A weeble wobbles here...
As you look at it the weeble wobbles - but it doesn't fall.
#

#
#message Diesel
Diesel leans casually against the wall, baseball bat swinging idly to and fro.

The jeweler is examining something in one of the cases.
The jeweler is hunched over one of the display cases, which has been opened. She has a jeweler's glass screwed firmly into her right eye.

A sinister looking black ship slides into your viewscreen...
The pirate seems appallingly well armed. The only break in the sleek black hull is the launching racks and the laser turrets. On one side is a blood red skull and crossbones.
#
#message LV
You see a discarded luncheon voucher in the corner.
It looks much the same as luncheon vouchers have throughout the centuries. The only unusual thing about it is that someone has written the name 'Cynthia' on the reverse...
#
#message Coin
A green coin gleams on the floor.
Looking more closely at the coin you discover that it is a 13-sided 283 groat piece. The head of the green person on the obverse looks suspiciously familiar...

You see a winged sugar cube. What were you expecting?
#
#message Barbells
A set of barbells rest on the floor.
They look VERY heavy - hernia class at least!

A grizzle approaches you ponderously...
Imagine an 18-foot high grizzly bear with razor sharp claws, and a spiked, lizard like tail... This is a rough approximation of the grizzle. Closer examination would be unwise!
#

The marine is using a worn pack of cards to play patience. As you watch he cheats by pulling a card from the bottom of the pack...
#

On top of the black pillar is a golden globe.
You examine the globe from a safe distance. Its surface crawls with undischarged energies, but even that apart, it would need a fairly solid tool to remove it from the pillar.
#
#message Thimble
Someone has dropped a thimble onto the floor.
It's a rather battered brass thimble, as used by your granny when sewing lace. There doesn't seem to be anything unusual about it.

It's quite reasonable soap - not your carbolic type. The scent is a bit strong though!
#
#message Badge
A yellow smiley badge grins inanely at you.

#
#message RouletteWheel
A roulette wheel on which you can gamble trader credits awaits you.

A battered token lies on the floor.
Looking more closely at the token you find that it has a picture of a wheatie on one side, and the number three on the other...
#
#message Piano
A battered honky-tonk piano sits in the corner.
The piano has seen better days! It looks as though Diesel has been leaning on it. You might be able to get a note or two out of it if you try to play it though.

#
#message SolEvent7
As you reach toward the zlitherworm, it suddenly lunges forward and bites off your hand...

As you attempt to get out of the building there is a surge of pent-up energy. The walls shimmer before your eyes and splinter into after-images...

#message SolEvent12
As you touch the diamond your puny mind is assaulted by a massive psionic blast. You stumble around mindlessly until eventually sanity returns.
#
#message SolEvent17
As you move closer to the lines psionic forces come into play, sucking the essence from your mind. Soon you are a dry husk, like the images that surround you.
#
#message SolEvent25
Your eyes smart and your lungs burn from the noxious atmosphere.
#
#message SolEvent32
You step through the looking glass. It feels as though every molecule in your body is flying apart... Eventually you are reassembled - elsewhere!
#
#message SolEvent33
The trip back is not as bad as the one coming here was - but that may be just because you knew what to expect! Eventually you regain your senses...
#
#message SolEvent37
Around you the walls suddenly dissolve into a black nothingness. Ravening energy pours through them and you burn up like a moth caught in a candle flame.
#
#message SolEvent42
A red panel lights up 'INTRUDER ALERT: BOOJUM SECTOR'. A hidden bank of lasers reduces you to a charcoal smear, soon cleared up by a passing cleaning robot!

   Well, you finally made it to the final frontier! There's not much to do now that you've gotten here though.
#
#message ArenaLocation25
Space
   Space - in the plane of the ecliptic, and right at the edge of known space.
#
#message ArenaLocation26

   Your ship is at the edge of known space...

#message ArenaLocation27
Space
   You are within the place of the ecliptic, somewhere near the edge of known space.

   You are in space - a long way out in space.

#message ArenaLocation30
Space
   Space, in the plane of the ecliptic. There seem to be a lot of micro-meteorites around.

#message ArenaLocation31
Space
   In the plane of the ecliptic. Your alarms squawk briefly as the automatics evade a meteor too large for the screens to handle.

#message ArenaLocation32

   The whole of this area is cluttered up with cosmic debris - one of the penalties for traveling in the plane of the ecliptic, I guess.

   Your thoughts turn to how little we know about the immensity of space...

#message ArenaLocation38
Space
   You are traveling in the plane of the ecliptic, at the very edge of the mapped out area.

#message ArenaLocation39
Space
   In the plane of the ecliptic, and moving steadily toward your destination...

#message ArenaLocation40
Space
   You look broodingly at the viewscreen, it's pretty empty, even though you are traveling in the plane of the ecliptic.
#
#message ArenaLocation41
Space
   At least traveling in the plane of the ecliptic you can't get lost. Or can you?
#
#message ArenaLocation42

   You regard your navigational instruments.
   Hmmm.... You are in the plane of the ecliptic, but you seem to be nearly off the edge of the map.

   You are in space below the plane of the ecliptic, surrounded by the debris of a long forgotten space battle.

   You are in a very distant part of space.

Staff Room
   Shadows fade off into the darkness as you look around you. It is difficult to estimate the true dimensions of this room. Effigy-studded walls continue far past the small circle of light afforded by the wall sconces.
   As your eye wanders toward the ceiling you notice capitals which seem to be sculpted with Norman enrichments. You observe that it must have cost quite a bundle for them to be smuggled out of Sol if they are real.
   To your left is the Jimi Chapel, dedicated to Himself, surrounded by Perpendicular stone-work screens. The Shrine to Himself is quite rich and is only shown to the most privileged of worshippers.
   To the right one can just make out an engraved listing of names surmounted by a depiction of GroundHogs being tortured in Hell. The quaint grotesques are certainly worthy of a closer examination.

Part of a sermon lies on the desk.
The sermon is about the need for people to cast out the devil within themselves - strong stuff! It is unfinished as though the author had left hurriedly in the middle of penning it.
#
# Snark location descriptions.
#
# The first paragraph is used as the brief location description; it
# should fit onto a single line. Subsequent paragraphs must begin with
# a 3 character indentation.

Corridor
   You are in a rock lined corridor, which stretches off to the southeast, lit at intervals by glowing orange globes. To the west is a door with a badly scuffed plaque. Looking carefully you can make out the words '...and Hyde Project', but the first part of the legend is indecipherable.
#
#message SnarkLocation10
Corridor
   You are in a corridor. Spaced at intervals along the wall are glowing orange globes. The corridor continues to the northwest, and runs into an open brightly lit area at its southeast end.
#
#message SnarkLocation11
Corridor
   You are in a well-used corridor. At the northeast end is a bar, and at the southwest end is an open space.
#
#message SnarkLocation12
Octagon
   You are in a brightly lit octagonal room. There are corridors to the northeast, southeast and northwest. There is also the entrance to a lift in the south wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation13
Corridor
   You are in a steel sheathed corridor. In addition to the normal lights, self-powered emergency lights are hung at intervals. Huge blast doors stand poised to swing into position at the touch of a remote switch...
   The corridor continues to the southeast, and enters a brightly lit space at the northwest end.
#
#message SnarkLocation14
Corridor
   You are at the southeastern end of a steel lined corridor. There are heavy steel doors to the south and the east.
#
#message SnarkLocation15
Corridor
   You are at the northern end of a rock corridor. The weird green lighting gives your face an unhealthy pallor. To the northeast is a steel door marked 'EXIT'.
#
#message SnarkLocation16
Corridor
   You are in a rock corridor lit by sickly green lighting. The corridor continues to your north, and it widens out to the south.
#
#message SnarkLocation17
Wide corridor
   The corridor widens at this point. The lighting is still a lurid green, but it seems a little brighter. A door in the east wall is marked 'CONTROL - KEEP OUT'.
   The corridor continues to the north and the southwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation18
Corridor
   You are at the southwest end of a corridor. A large hole has been excavated in the west wall, but the darkness hides anything beyond the wall.
   To the north is a strangely wrought door with a large skull and crossbones etched into it...
#
#message SnarkLocation19
Cave
   You are in a large cave. To the east green light spills in from the corridor. A worn path leads from the opening in the east wall to another opening to the northwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation20
Tunnel
   You are in a roughly worked tunnel. The rusting remains of rails running along the floor indicate that you are in a disused mine working. To the west a steep shaft drops away from your feet, and the tunnel runs southeast.
#
#message SnarkLocation21
Shaft
   You are climbing a set of rust iron handholds set into the walls of a vertical shaft. The handholds look not too secure...
   Below you the shaft vanishes into darkness, but the handholds go no farther down. To the south is a dark hole in the shaft wall, and above you the handholds continue for as far as the light of your torch reaches.
#
#message SnarkLocation22
Mine face
   You are crouched in an abandoned mine working. To one side there is a glint from the remains of the worked out vein.
   Judging from the gloomy air of neglect, no one has been here for a very long time. The exit is north into a shaft.
#
#message SnarkLocation23
Packing room
   This seems to be the place where drugs are prepared and packaged. In one corner is a tabletting machine, and on the shelves are boxes of empty ampoules. None of the machinery is in use at the moment. The exit is east.
#
#message SnarkLocation24
Laboratory
   You are in a laboratory. Vile looking substances bubble through towers of glassware, and there is a steady drip, drip from a distillation apparatus.
   To the east is the door into the corridor, to the southwest is a steel door with the word 'DANGER' stenciled on it in large, bright red lettering.
#
#message SnarkLocation25
Bar
   You are in a depressing looking bar. All the furniture and fittings look as old and the counter has a number of laser scars along its length. The clientele is, as you would expect, colorful, but most are keeping to themselves.
   There is an exit to the southwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation26
Office
   Yes, even pirates need administrators! This is an office, but there is little of interest in it. The door is northwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation27
Lift
   You are in an old fashioned lift with sliding gates. You can either go up, or leave the lift by going north.
#
#message SnarkLocation28
Septilateral room
   You are standing in a seven-sided room. In the center is a curious tower structure, covered with whorls that remind you of the ruins on Mars. The sides of the room are covered with control and monitoring equipment of an unfamiliar design.
   Through the transparent floor you can see huge busbars carrying vast amounts of power to the structure.
   The exit is in the south wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation29
Cannon room
   Running through the room is the barrel of a gigantic particle cannon. Supercooled magnetic coils sparkle with frost, and from the depths of the rock floor comes a deep humming, more felt than heard.
   There are two exits to the chamber - east and west.
#
#message SnarkLocation30
Transfer control
   You are in what is obviously some sort of control room. Most of the equipment is unfamiliar, but your attention is drawn to a console marked 'TRANSFER PORTAL'.
   You look over the console, but are unable to figure out how it works.
   There is an exit in the west wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation31
Missile room
   Missiles lie in rack all around you, waiting to be fed into the silos in the asteroid's defense facilities. As you watch a robot arm feeds a missile into a tube, and another missile is moved into the vacated place.
   There is an exit to the north.
#
#message SnarkLocation32
Security room
   You are in a bare room. A closed circuit TV camera follows your movements. At the south end of the room is a door leading to the corridor, while at the north end is a door with a sign saying 'DANGER - NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL'.
#
#message SnarkLocation33
Reactor control
   You are in the control room of the nuclear reactor supplying the asteroid's power. The control room is a glass lined gallery running across the north end of the reactor room.
   Stairs lead down to the floor of the reactor room to the south, and there is a door in the west wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation34
Reactor room
   You are on the floor of the reactor room. The reactor's pile towers above you, and close inspection reveals that it is in dire need of a service.
   A Geiger counter on the wall is showing an unhealthily high radiation reading. The way out is up to the north.
#
#message SnarkLocation35
Living quarters
   You are in the living area. On one side is a large bed. Underfoot are scattered worn, but tasteful, rugs. A holo unit stands in front of a comfortable, old fashioned bamboo sofa.
   The holo unit is displaying a book on cryptography, and is open at the section on the use of one-time pads.
   The door is southeast.
#
#message SnarkLocation36
Transmitter room
   Most of this room is taken up by a very large hyperspace transceiver unit. It is unusual that it also seems to have a scanner built into it. If you have the correct information you could probably contact the DNI by using the 'type' command.
#
#message SnarkLocation37
Computer room
   The room is chock full of ancient computer gear. On a bench is a dust covered console, but no amount of fiddling with it by you will bring it to life. Against one wall is an original 110 baud DECwriter printer! There is a door to the southwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation38
Storeroom
   You are in a tiny storeroom. The shelves are crammed with all the needs and necessities of life in this barren environment. There is an exit to the southwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation39
Galley
   This is a compact galley - it bears more than a passing resemblance to the one in your ship. In fact, looking more closely, you have the feeling that it might originally have been a spaceship galley.
   There is an exit in the east wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation40
Open space
   You are in an open space. The floor, while uneven, has been smoothed by playing a laser over it to fuse the rubble. Passages lead off to the east, southeast and southwest. There are doors in all other directions.
#
#message SnarkLocation41
Corridor
   You are in a short corridor. To the west is an open area, while to the northeast and the southeast are doors.
#
#message SnarkLocation42
Passage
   You are in a rock-lined passage running from the northeast to the southwest, where there is a featureless steel door barring your way. Carved into the wall next to the door is a sign saying 'EMERGENCY EXIT'.
#
#message SnarkLocation43
Workshop
   You are looking round a small workshop. Various partially disassembled gadgets are lying on the benches. In one corner is a small lathe with a complex-looking jig, and a quad trace oscilloscope is built into the test bench.
   Examining the lathe more closely you come to the conclusion that you would be able to use it if you were to put the correct item into the jig!
   There is a door to the north.
#
#message SnarkLocation44
Narrow passage
   You are squeezing through a narrow rock passage running from the south to the northwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation45
Holo room
   You are in a room full of holograms which looks suspiciously like another holo room you know of... In the center of the room is a holo of a large fish. A plaque under it reads 'Hareng rouge'...
   The exit is northwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation46
Mirror room
   You are in a small rocky room. There is a door to the northeast and set into the northern wall is a mirror of the sort that brought you here.
   A large grinning guard stands in front of the mirror pointing an ion rifle at you. You skid to a halt, dismayed. Even as your brain tries to comprehend what is happening you run out of time and the first of the nuclear missiles arrives.
#
#message SnarkLocation47
Cave
   You are in a round smooth cave, obviously artificial, but apparently leading nowhere. To the south is the energy curtain holding the atmosphere in the cave, though why it should be doing so is a mystery.
#
#message SnarkLocation48
Energy curtain
   You are standing in an energy field. Is this wise? Your skin tingles, and you feel euphoric. North leads into a cave, and south leads out toward the surface.
#
#message SnarkLocation49
Cannon control
   This appears to be a control room for the particle cannon. Various dials and knobs labeled intensity, direction, focus, etc. festoon the control panels.
   There are doors in the east and south walls.
#
#message SnarkLocation50
Missile control
   Racked around the room are missile guidance units and tracking computers. Judging from the amount of equipment the asteroid is not short on the defenses! There is a door in the west wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation51
Bunker entrance
   You are in the entrance to the bunker. North leads into the bunker, south out to the surface of the asteroid.
#
#message SnarkLocation52
Cave
   You are in a dimly lit cave. The light comes from the shifting colors of an energy curtain at the north end. The cave exit is south.
#
#message SnarkLocation53
Ravine
   You are in a narrow ravine whose walls appear to be on the point of meeting overhead. The darkness is nearly absolute, but by the light of your torch you can see a cave mouth to the north.
   To the southwest the ravine broadens out a little.
#
#message SnarkLocation54
Ravine
   You are at the western end of a deep ravine. To the north and west the side of the ravine rises sharply, but to the south the cliff has crumbled under a meteorite impact, making it just possible to climb up.
#
#message SnarkLocation55
Ravine
   You are in a deep east/west ravine which scores the surface of the asteroid. The cliffs on either side are unclimbable, and the ravine narrows as it runs eastwards.
#
#message SnarkLocation56
Ravine
   The ravine runs round from the west to the northeast, narrowing considerably at the northeast end. Looking up you can see the sharp silhouette of the cliff edges far above you.
   The northeast end of the ravine is shrouded in darkness.
#
#message SnarkLocation57
Ravine
   You are a one end of a ravine which runs northeast. To the north and west cliffs rise sheer and unclimbable. To the east the slopes have crumbled and can be traversed relatively easily.
   To the south rises the bulk of an old spoil heap.
#
#message SnarkLocation58
Surface
   You are stumbling about on the uneven surface of the asteroid. To the north the ground slopes down to the bottom of a ravine, while to the east and south the uneven surface continues.
#
#message SnarkLocation59
Surface
   You are wandering around the surface of the asteroid. To your east the ground becomes more broken, to the north is an abrupt drop into a deep ravine. To the south your way is blocked by a scarred and battered concrete wall.
#
#message SnarkLocation60
Surface
   You are walking very carefully over a glassy area. The surface is fused as though hit by a massively powerful laser beam. You marvel at the forces that could have wrought such havoc.
   To the east is a spoil heap, southeast is the start of a path. To the north is a steep drop into a deep ravine - not recommended!
#
#message SnarkLocation61
Surface
   The surface of the asteroid is very broken. To the west and northwest the ground drops away abruptly. Southwest is a sign saying 'DANGER - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY'. Beyond it you can see the launching tubes of missile silos.
#
#message SnarkLocation62
Surface
   Your feet skid as you walk over the glassy surface. To the east is the start of a path leading to a squat, ugly looking blockhouse. To the west is a battered concrete wall which prevents movement in that direction.
#
#message SnarkLocation63
Surface
   You are on the asteroid's surface. To your northeast is a low concrete building with an airlock in its south face. To the west you can see missile silos.
   In a southerly direction the ground becomes too broken move around.
#
#message SnarkLocation64
Surface
   You are on the surface of the asteroid. To your north is an airlock, to the south and southwest the surface is an impassable jumble of boulders. To the southeast you can see groups of missile silos.
#
#message SnarkLocation65
Surface
   You are wandering around on the surface of the asteroid. It is difficult to say where the light is coming from - a greenish-blue radiance seems to emanate from all directions overhead. South are missile silos.
   East is an unpleasant looking pit. You can see the gleam of an oily looking liquid in the bottom. You find this puzzling considering you are in a vacuum...
#
#message SnarkLocation66
Spoil heap
   You are standing on one of the slopes of an old spoil heap. The detritus has been burrowed into many times by scavengers, making it not a little unsafe. As you shift your weight it precipitates a small avalanche of rubble...
   To the north is the start of a ravine, and to the northeast and the east is broken ground.
#
#message SnarkLocation67
Spoil heap
   You are standing on a heap of old slag and waste left over from the time when this was a mining asteroid. On the south side of the heap is the start of a path leading to a blockhouse.
   North and east of the heap the surface becomes impossible broken and impassable.
#
#message SnarkLocation68
Small spoil heap
   You are perched on the top of a small spoil heap, from which you can look out over a bleak landscape. The only safe way off the heap is by going north.
#
#message SnarkLocation69
Missile silos
   You are in an area dotted with missile silos. You'd better be out of the area when the missiles are fired, unless you wish to get frazzled by the backlash!
   You can leave by going northeast or east. In all other directions the ground is too broken to move.
#
#message SnarkLocation70
Airlock
   You are in a rarely used airlock. The mechanisms are very stiff, and it takes all your strength to move them.
   To the north the airlock leads into a lift and to the south is the exit to the asteroid's surface.
#
#message SnarkLocation71
Path
   You are at the west end of an east/west path made from crushed rock.
   The path weaves a little to avoid obstacles, and appears to be heading toward a low blockhouse just visible to the east. To the north is a spoil heap.
#
#message SnarkLocation72
Path
   You are walking along an east/west path made with crushed stone. You cannot get off the path because of the ragged nature of the terrain.
#
#message SnarkLocation73
Path
   You are standing on a path. To the west the path runs over the asteroid's nearby horizon. To the east is the entrance to a blockhouse.
   The southern arm of the path leads through an area dotted with sensors to the landing pad.
#
#message SnarkLocation74
Pit
   You scramble down into the pit and are standing knee deep in the strange oil like substance. The 'oil' seems to have a life of its own. Ripples run across the surface and it slops hungrily around the legs of your space suit...
#
#message SnarkLocation75
Blockhouse
   You are in the single room that makes up the blockhouse. Three of the walls are rough hewn blocks, but the north wall looks very much like the black, gold flecked material to be found in the Martian ruins. Set into the wall is a softly glowing silvery mirror.
   To the west is an exit leading to the surface of the asteroid.
#
#message SnarkLocation76
Sensor array
   You are in the middle of a flat area containing a sensor array. Most of the rigs are familiar, but one or two of the antennas look a little strange.
   A path runs north to south through the area, connecting the landing pad in the south to the main pathway in the north. To the east is the business end of a large particle cannon.
#
#message SnarkLocation77
Particle cannon
   The muzzle of a very large particle cannon pokes out of the ground. Massive deflector coils circle it, gleaming nightmarishly in the strange light from overhead.
   The surrounding area is very broken but it is possible to move west, where there is an impressive array of sensors, and northwest.
#
#message SnarkLocation78
Lift
   You are in an old-fashioned lift with sliding concertina gates. Mind you don't trap your fingers!
   Down will take you down, and south will take you into the airlock.
#
#message SnarkLocation79
Landing area
   This is the asteroid's landing area. It looks inhospitable and bleak. To the north is the start of a path leading toward a blockhouse, low down on the asteroid's shockingly near horizon.
#
#message SnarkLocation80
Silos
   You are in an area dotted with missile silos. Not the place to be caught in when they are being launched! An energy curtain runs from the east round to the south.
   West is an unclimbable jumble of boulders.
#
#message SnarkSnarkOrbit
Snark orbit
   Beneath you lies the seared and blackened asteroid known as Snark. Your instruments make it clear that it is far from being uninhabited, though!
#
#message SnarkLocation82
Hilbert Space
   The space around you is permeated with a strange greenish-blue glow. Your instruments suggest that you are looking at the residual tachyon radiation caused by the creation of neutron/anti-neutron pairs out of nothingness.
   You are suitably awed by this revelation.
#
#message SnarkLocation83
Hilbert Space
   You find the green-blue glow unsettling, but a flicker of your mass-magnetometer indicates the possibility of something to the east of your present position.
#
#message SnarkLocation84
Hilbert Space
   You feel as if you are on the edge of nowhere. Angrily you cut in the filters to remove the flickering light from outside.
#
#message SnarkLocation85
Hilbert Space
   You are flying through Hilbert Space by the seat of your pants. None of your instruments are making any sense at all.
#
#message SnarkLocation86
Hilbert Space
   The all pervading greenish-blue light seems to be affecting your sense of direction. You are beginning to be worried about whether you are flying round in circles.
#
#message SnarkLocation87
Hilbert Space
   You wish that you were out of this blue-green nightmare, and safely back in normal space.
#
#message SnarkLocation88
Hilbert Space
   Space here is curiously striated. You have no idea what it means as bands of green and blue march past your window in weird, unfathomable sequences.
#
#message SnarkLocation89
Hilbert Space
   The space around you seems to break up into a jumble of black patches and bright green blotches, all superimposed on a blue-green striated background.
#
#message SnarkLocation90
Hilbert Space
   You are drifting in an interminable sea of blue-green light. You find it very disorienting!
#
#message SnarkLocation91
Hilbert Space
   Looking at the viewscreen - a seemingly random pattern of blues and greens - you start to feel spacesick...
#
#message SnarkLocation92
Hilbert Space
   Green flakes seem to drift past - though your instruments insist that there is nothing there - and jagged blue pinpoints pulse on the screen. Your ship seems to crawl through the sector...
#
#message SnarkLocation93
Hilbert Space
   This sector of Hilbert Space seems relatively quiet. The greenish-blue glow has faded to a soft velvety background through which your ship moves smoothly.
#
#message SnarkLocation94
Out Through The Looking Glass
   Uses event to move player through location.
#
# Sol object and mobile descriptions.
#
# Each message has exactly 2 paragraphs. The first is seen by the player
# when they enter a location or use LOOK or GLANCE; this should fit on a
# single line. The third is seen by the player when they EXAMINE the
# object.
#
#process O
#
#message Care
The Care planetary defense satellite is in the sector...
Judging from the number of gun muzzles protruding, it would be extremely unhealthy to hang around in this area.
#
#message Caretaker
The base caretaker is pottering here.
As you approach him, the caretaker casts a beady eye over you suspiciously. The way he fingers his comm unit makes you think he's just itching for you to give him a reason to call a guard.
#
#message Converter
You see an n-space drive converter.
You know it is an n-space drive converter, but you need more information on what to do with it.
#
#message HilbertWind
A Hilbert wind whirls violently nearby.
It looks very much like a tornado, but is made up of some kind of energy that you don't immediately recognize. Closer inspection may be unwise...
#
#message Hope
The Hope sector defense satellite spins slowly in the center of the sector.
The satellite bristles with weaponry - not at all nice!
#
#message Lever
A rusty lever is embedded in the wall.
The lever obviously hasn't been moved for a long time. It seems to have rusted solid, though it is possible that a little lubrication might help shift it. Always assuming you do want to move it!
#
#message Paper
You see some listing paper with what seems to be a coded message.
Printed on the paper is: Snark coordinates are '{%s}'. You can enter the coordinates into the transmitter with the TYPE command.
#
#message Patrol
The guard patrol is here, looking for interlopers.
The leader of the patrol stiffens as he sees you. He fingers his laser; he's just itching to shoot you for no good reason at all.
#
#message Potion
You can see a flask of potion.
The potion is inky-black, with strange gold flecks that swarm and move around in it.
#
#message TuningFork
You spot a tuning fork lying on the floor.
Closer examination, and a bit of experimentation, establish that it is an 'A flat' tuning fork...
